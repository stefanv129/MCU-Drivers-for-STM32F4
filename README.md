STM32F4 bare metal drivers for UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO/RCC created from 0 using embedded C language
-these drivers are intended as tools for my future projects, they are individual work
-stm32f4 documentation was crucial
-the stm drivers have stm32f4 in their name (i worked with stm32f401re-NUCLEO board)
-I will post more drivers as I test them (SPI and I2C are very hard to test without a SLAVE device)
-I will also post projects using these drivers in this repository (maybe using an LCD with SPI and LED Matrix)
//I will show the projects YouTube videos maybe?
